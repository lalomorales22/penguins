# Agent Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping is the **first‑run** ritual that prepares an agent workspace and
collects identity details. It happens after onboarding, when the agent starts
for the first time.

## What bootstrapping does

On the first agent run, Penguins bootstraps the workspace (default
`~/.penguins/workspace`):

- Seeds `AGENTS.md`, `BOOTSTRAP.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`.
- Runs a short Q&A ritual (one question at a time).
- Writes identity + preferences to `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`, `SOUL.md`.
- Removes `BOOTSTRAP.md` when finished so it only runs once.

## Where it runs

Bootstrapping always runs on the **gateway host**. If you reach the Gateway
remotely through Cloudflare, Tailscale, or SSH, the workspace and bootstrapping
files still live on that remote machine.

<Note>
When the Gateway runs on another machine, edit workspace files on the gateway
host (for example, `user@gateway-host:~/.penguins/workspace`).
